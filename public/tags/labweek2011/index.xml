&lt;p>On Monday we are kicking off an innovation week (more to come on that topic) and I've devised a little project that includes nearly every buzzword I'm interested in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm spending some time doing some technical spikes to see what is possible and I found a need to load a particular file from a git repo given the path and tree hash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I grabbed my trusty python, dulwich (native python-git library) and gave it a shot. After a few minutes writing complicated looking recursive code I jumped over to irc where the friendly author pointed me to a convenience function that does what I needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is the short answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>from dulwich.repo import Repo
from dulwich.object_store import tree_lookup_path&lt;/p>
&lt;p>r = Repo('/Documents/projects/gitdep/rails')
def get_file(tree, path):
(mode,sha) = tree_lookup_path(r.get_object,tree,path)
return r[sha].data&lt;/p>
&lt;p>tree = '7e7331fce169bbe1d6be71a30c1e1f7ab2e6ceba'
path = 'activemodel/examples/validations.rb'&lt;/p>
&lt;p>print get_file(tree,path)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gives me a rails validation file from last year. Nothing special about this file, I just find the rails git repo an interesting playground for git experimentation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
