&lt;p>We went to Table 31 at the base of the Comcast center for dinner tonight.  It was an excellent restaurant week menu.  Most of the places doing restaurant week push the up-sell pretty hard but this was an exception.  They had the all inclusive $35 menu on the table.  Even better they had a selection of wines under $50 that they recommended and our was very nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The waiter was very nice and handled my 'special needs' diet.  Well at least I think that he did, but I'll know for sure tomorrow if I accidentally ingested some wheat.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
