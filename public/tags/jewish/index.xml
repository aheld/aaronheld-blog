&lt;p>I attended a book signing and talk by &lt;a href="http://www.boonin.com/">Harry Boonin&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=kesher+israel&amp;amp;near=Philadelphia,+PA&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;cid=39942639,-75149153,8115982947485271748&amp;amp;li=lmd&amp;amp;ll=39.942713,-75.149145&amp;amp;spn=0.041326,0.072098&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=A">Kesher Isreal&lt;/a> today.  He gave an interesting talk about the history of the temple and an insight into the history of the Jews in Philly.  An interesting bit was his mention of a part of the building's history where the Christian community collaborated with the Jewish community during a move and had mutual respect for each others religious paraphernalia.  I have to wonder how the different communities could understand each other without wikipedia!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
