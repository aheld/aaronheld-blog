&lt;p>My father was featured on Hoda's Bucket list segment on the Today show.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My dad never really wanted to talk about his past in public, but recently he met one of the soldiers from the US 30th Infantry who rescued him. With the passing of the last of the group who rescued him, he now wants to ensure his story is told. The today show segment didn't go into detail of his rescue, but men like Matthew Rozell and Frank Towers have documented it on &lt;a href="https://teachinghistorymatters.com/2016/03/01/the-last-transport/">Teaching History Matters&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://www.today.com/news/80-year-old-dad-who-survived-holocaust-gets-ultimate-surprise-t102666">Today Show did a great job of telling his story&lt;/a>) and I'm appreciative of the support that he has gotten since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The video seems to have expired, but I found another write up at &lt;a href="http://www.thepostgame.com/holocaust-survivor-john-mcenroe-today-show-surprise">the post game&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
