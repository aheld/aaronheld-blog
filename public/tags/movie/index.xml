&lt;p>Taking of Pelham 123 on Fancast!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went looking for the trailer of the original Pelham 123 and was plesantly surprised to find the full lenght movie on Fancast!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was one of my favorite movies as a kid and well worth watching. There are some comments out there about how this is a well done film in terms of pacing, so I hope that they model that in the remake.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I watched &lt;a href="http://www.fancast.com/movies/Michael-Clayton/30659/main">Michael Clayton&lt;/a> today&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.fancast.com/movies/Michael-Clayton/30659/main">&lt;img src="https://www.aaronheld.com/assets/posts/images/1188416932882_15MichaelClayton_mif.jpg_121_87.jpg" alt="George Clooney as Michael Clayton" title="George Clooney as Michael Clayton">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A decent legal / espionage plot. Predictive enough. The lawyer is defending an international chemical company for years.  One day he goes off his anti-depressants and decides to champion the farmers being killed by the chemical additives. Drama ensues when the 'fixer' Michael Clayton is set on the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the lawyer who had the breakdown was Michael's friend, and since Mr. Clayton has a good relationship with his son, so we assume he is not wholly evil. Its a good thing we don't live in a world with people that would allow this to happen. A quick googling shows that our government recently decided to immediately &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/06/AR2007020600105.html">phase out a harmful pesticide (that has been in use since 1950s) by 2012&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aaron's improved ending: Michael takes the money at the end, leaves his stressful life behind and the movie closes with him sipping a drink on th beach.&lt;/p>
