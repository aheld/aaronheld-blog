&lt;p>Agility is one of the most abused terms in my profession.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent events in my day job have caused me to rethink what agility means.  We have a very elegant, loosely coupled system that allows us to build entire sections of our website in hours.  The framework handles everything from CDN integration to doing automated profiling every build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software engineers have to be good at identifying the bottleneck, and over the past few days I saw how the larger teams ability to react mattered much more then the codebase itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a topic I'll have to explore after some rest&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
