I've been excited about software since I discovered Asyst in the late 80s. I was working in a lab using rulers to measure data collected on paper charts. After transcribing enough data points I then calculated Fourier transforms by hand. An older grad student took pity on me and showed me this amazing computer that could be connected to the instruments and do in a few hours what took me weeks to do by hand!

The data went from electical impulses in a goat to analyzed output in record time and I never had to do math by hand since!

 Since then I've watched "the computer" go from my personal force multiplier to an indespensible part of most peoples lives. 
 
 While the tech world was innovating, I moved around the east coast and had a trilogy of childen.  I am appily married to a [Philly](https://www.visitphilly.com/) girl and made this city my home.
