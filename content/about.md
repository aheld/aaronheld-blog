I've been excited about software since I discovered Asyst in the late 80s. I was working in a lab using rulers to measure data collected on paper charts. After transcribing enough data points I then calculated Fourier transforms by hand. An older grad student took pity on me and showed me this amazing computer that could be connected to the instruments and do in a few hours what took me weeks to do by hand! Since then I've watched "the computer" go from my personal force multiplier to an indespensible part of most peoples lives. In the meantime I had a trilogy of childen and am happily married, living in sunny Philadelphia, PA.
