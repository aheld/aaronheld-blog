The vote turnout is really impressive. Its more like a party or superbowl. Actually from the high quality tv spots this election is definitely nearing superbowl quality. Maybe we need to let Fox and CNN bid for exclusive coverage rights....

Anyway after I voted I took the kiddies to vote at the Bucks county kid election: ![Ardith voting](img_2713.jpg "Ardith's vote") ![Molly's votes](img_2711.jpg "molly's vote")

The culture is so different now.

What is next for civil duties? People actually wanting to serve on Juries?
