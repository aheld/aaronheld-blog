### Does my marriage need more FHIR?


Originally I added my 'Marriage to Jen' in my [LinkedIn work history](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronheld/) as a private joke.  Almost immediately it was effective in filtering sales and recruiting calls to let me know they had actually read my profile.

I’m keeping it because now it’s helping me find the bots.

How insulting! They were promoting FHIR (pronounced "fire") so inappropriate to insinuate that I need to spice up my marriage over linkedIn. 😂

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, /faɪər/, like fire) standard is a set of rules and specifications for the secure exchange of electronic health care data.


I replaced the name and in the post, but it was real.  The bot image is from https://medium.com/iconfinder/create-a-set-of-scalable-flat-robot-icons-in-adobe-illustrator-fb393e224d9b
