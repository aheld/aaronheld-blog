### Does my marriage need more FHIR?

I read this as being solicited to spice up my marriage. Wildly inappropriate for LinedIn ðŸ˜‚. 
FHIR is pronounced "fire".

Originally I added my 'Marriage to Jen' in my [LinkedIn work history](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronheld/) as a private joke.  Almost immediately it was effective in filtering sales and recruiting calls to let me know they had actually read my profile.

Iâ€™m keeping it because now itâ€™s helping me find the bots.

> The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, /faÉªÉ™r/, like fire) standard is a set of rules and specifications for the secure exchange of electronic health care data.

I replaced the name and image the post, but the text is unchanged.  The bot image is from https://medium.com/iconfinder/create-a-set-of-scalable-flat-robot-icons-in-adobe-illustrator-fb393e224d9b
