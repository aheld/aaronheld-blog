 I was watching [Kitchen Nightmares](http://www.fox.com/kitchennightmares/recaps/season1/106_1.htm) where Chef Gordon Ramsay verbally attacks restaurant  owners in order to point out the areas where they lack.
 
 I used to think he was just another character on TV but there was a    turning point in that episode. The owner was berating everyone around him and   causing so much stress that his customers noticed and his business was failing. People from the Chef to the Hostess noticed the problems but they didn't try to fix the core issue. This owner was a good enough chef to start a  successful restaurant and then use that to open a second one in a beautiful space.
