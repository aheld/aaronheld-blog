AI won't kill middle managers. It will free them.

I got into management to be a player-coach—someone who could create *and* multiply team effectiveness. 

Shielding talented people from bad direction, then watching them deliver has been yielded the most rewarding times of my career. 

Chris Dixon's recent move to hands-on engineering got me thinking about what middle managers actually do—and what we should be doing.

For years, I've played two roles: **The Shield** (protecting teams from organizational chaos) and **The Amplifier** (carrying technical truth upward when executives don't want to hear it). That translation work? It's shrinking.

AI makes that less necessary. When individual contributors can articulate problems completely, they can communicate directly with decision-makers. The gap between "knowing what to build" and "building it" narrows.

This isn't a threat to middle managers. It's a threat to executives who've been outsourcing their understanding.

What we can focus on now:
- Being force multipliers—hands-on engineers who mentor while shipping
- Building psychological safety where people do their best work
- Solving complex problems that benefit from experience
- Actually creating value instead of just coordinating it

The uncomfortable truth? The future means we can go around leaders who don't step up. When executives relied on us to translate and buffer, they could stay technically distant. AI removes that luxury from everyone.

Skilled managers won't be replaced. How we deliver value will evolve.

Everyone is saying we need fewer layers between developer and management, and I'm realizeing now that we need fewer layers between developers who build the product and our customer who use it and investors who fund it.
